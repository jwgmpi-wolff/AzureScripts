Description: 
  Script Description: Calendar Event Creation via Microsoft Graph with Azure Key Vault Integration
This PowerShell script automates the creation of a Microsoft Teams calendar event using Microsoft Graph API
 and securely retrieves credentials from Azure Key Vault. It is designed for use within the context of the 
 wolffofficesub Azure subscription.

  Setup and Authentication
Modules & Context: Imports the Microsoft Graph Calendar module and sets the Azure subscription context.
Graph Connection: Connects to Microsoft Graph with delegated permissions for managing applications and role 
assignments.
  Key Vault Access
Vault Configuration: Updates network rules and public access settings for the Key Vault named wolffofficekvkv2 
in resource group Adminrg.
Secret Retrieval: Attempts to retrieve the client secret for the app registration WOLFFCalendarManagerAppspn. 
If blocked by firewall rules, it dynamically adds the client IP to the Key Vault’s access list and retries.
  Token Acquisition
Uses the retrieved client secret to request an access token from Microsoft’s OAuth2 endpoint for Graph API access.
  Calendar Event Definition
Defines a Teams meeting titled “POC Strategy Sync” for user jerrywolff@wpi-corp.com, scheduled on July 31, 2025, 
from 10:00 AM to 11:00 AM PST.
Includes HTML-formatted body content and specifies the meeting as online via Teams.
  Event Creation
Retrieves the target user's email via Graph.
Sends a POST request to Microsoft Graph to create the calendar event.
Logs the response to a local file for auditing.
